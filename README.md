# Data Analysis Repository - IBM Data Analyst Professional Course

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Analysis Repository, part of the "IBM Data Analyst" Professional Course on Coursera. This repository contains a collection of datasets and analyses exploring various domains. The datasets have been sourced from Kaggle and other reliable sources, and they cover topics such as car sales, fleet data, and more.

## Files

### 1. `Montgomery Fleets Data`

This file contains fleet data for Montgomery Fleets. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and has undergone rigorous cleaning to remove empty and redundant rows. Additionally, spelling mistakes and incorrect data types were corrected. The repository includes an in-depth analysis of this dataset, showcasing insights derived using pivot tables and other statistical methods.


### 2. `Car Sales Data`

This file presents the focal point of our car sales analysis, featuring data for the years 2018 and 2019. The dataset offers comprehensive information on various car models, their sales figures, and associated attributes. It has been meticulously cleaned and prepared for analysis.

### 3. `Python Project`

This file contains data extracted from both Tesla and GameStop sources. The data retrieval process involved calling APIs to obtain a JSON file and utilizing web scraping techniques with the Beautiful Soup library to parse webpage HTML tags. The extracted data was converted into pandas data frames for further analysis. The repository includes code and visualizations that uncover valuable insights from this combined dataset.

### 4. `Other DataSets/`

This folder contains additional datasets used for practice and exploration during the "IBM Data Analyst" Professional Course. The datasets cover diverse domains, providing opportunities to apply various data analysis techniques and gain valuable insights.

## Data Analysis

In this project, we conducted in-depth data analysis on multiple datasets using Python and Excel. The Jupyter Notebook files and Python scripts in the repository walk through the data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization processes. Each analysis is thoroughly documented, making it easy to understand the methods used and the insights obtained.

Through our investigations, we aimed to answer critical questions, discover trends, and gain meaningful insights into the datasets, enabling better decision-making in various business and research contexts.
